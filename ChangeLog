v0.8 - Sept 3, 2011
- added an "offenseCount" parameter, which defines the number of Honeypot
offenses before action is taken.  When action is taken, the Honeypot blocks
that were broken are automatically rolled back. Defaults to 1, which is the
previous default behavior (one block break = immediate action).

v0.7.2 - Sept 2, 2011
- added support for vanilla and EasyBan
- added 'honeypotBanReason' config option (ban reason for EB and MCBANS), defaults to "Destroyed honeypot block."
- added 'kickBanSender' config option (who banning, kicking - only MCBANS), defaults to "[Honeypot]"
- added 'doLoc' config option (location of player into ban reason, all ban systems), defaults to "false"
- code cleanup

v0.7.1 - July 3, 2011
- added 'logpath' config option, defaults to "plugins/Honeypot/honeypot.log"

v0.7
- fixed bug on saving that caused data file to be wiped out
- made multiworld compatible
- performance improvements, since this is called on every block break and
was previously not very efficient for a large number of Honeypot blocks
- added ant build script for building jar

v6
- last release by @aArgomirr
